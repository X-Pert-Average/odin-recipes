    <h1>Marinara Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza-marinara.jpeg" alt="A Tasty Marinara Pizza">
    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>A recipe for a traditional Italian Pizza Marinara. The original Pizza Marinara is vegan and only served with tomato sauce, garlic and oregano. The Marinara is a true pizza classic and comes from Naples like the Pizza Margherita. Unlike the vegetarian Margherita, the Marinara contains no cheese. The fresh tomato sauce, the garlic and the oregano combine with the pizza dough to a very delicious taste experience. Depending on your preference, a dash of olive oil can be added.</p> 

        <p>Incidentally, a real vegan Pizza Marinara has nothing to do with the seafood pizza, which is usually available under the name Marinara. The name of the Marinara goes back to Italian sailors. Due to the good shelf life of all ingredients, it could also be freshly prepared on the high seas and used as provisions for long sea voyages.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp semolina</li>
            <li>1 tbs garlic oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>800g chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin the dough preparation 24 hours prior. Combine yeast and 600ml lukewarm water in a bowl, cover and stand for 10 minutes or until frothy. Combine flour and 1/3 cup (27g) salt flakes in a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Add yeast mixture and oil, and knead for 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a greased bowl, cover and stand in a warm place for 2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into six 280g balls, place on a tray, cover and chill for 24 hours (dough can be frozen for up to 6 months). Stand at room temperature for 1 hour before baking.</li>
            <li>For the garlic oil, combine oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat, bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or until garlic is tender. Transfer to a glass jar.</li>
            <li>For the tomato passata, place tomatoes, sugar, oil and 1/2 tsp salt flakes in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 40 minutes or until reduced.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 250Â°C. Grease a large round pizza tray or baking tray and scatter with semolina.</li>
            <li>Roll out dough, from the inside to the outer edge on a lightly floured surface, to form a 24cm round. Place on prepared tray. Spread base with passata, garlic, garlic oil and dried oregano. Bake for 10 minutes or until pizza is cooked through. Scatter with oregano leaves and anchovies to serve.</li>
        </ol>
